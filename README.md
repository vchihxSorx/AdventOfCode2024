# Advent Of Code 2024

In this project I'll resolve both the Advent of Code problems of each day to reinforce my programming skills both in Java and Php.
goals:
  - complete it and take all the fifty star
  - revise java and learn better php(i studied Java in forth year of high school, now I'm at the fifth and I'm studing php)
  - try to make the code as optimal as possible
